# DrawingTool
This is a drawing tool which is developed by C#. it is not much functional but a project for me to learn ASP.NET development.

## Functions
- Users can draw lines by entering coordinates or click mouse on the canvas.
- Users can remove some lines if they want.
- Users can decide certain line's color.
- Users can also find intersections of lines they drawed. The color of intersections are consistent with the color they have chosen.
